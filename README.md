relationships betweeen classes, abstract classes, and interfaces
using Backendless as a backend service 
data persistence using cloud storage

Conclusion Questions
1)  What are the benefits of adding a back end for an application? 
Having a back end for an application makes the app much more user friendly. The back end allows for local data, such as profiles and/or preferences, to instead be stored in the cloud. This means that data is no longer stored locally, and can be accessed across devices with access to the backend.

2) What is a Backend as a Service and how does it work? Include as much detail as you can about the infrastructure and implementation.  Include any interesting notes from class presentations.
